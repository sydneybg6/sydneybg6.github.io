- I would like to learn how to work with a 3D printer, as I didnâ€™t have the chance to do so in our Education Commons Project. The idea of turning digital data into a tangible product is very interesting to me and I find very intriguing the complexity of a 3D printer. I plan on going back to the Education Commons next semester to learn more about this tool
  
- I want to learn how to use the software, Tableau, as it is widely used in corporate America for data visualization. I plan to learn more about this tool to enhance my ability to present analytical findings, specifically as I graduate college and expand on my career.
  
- I plan to read the book, Ethics of the Algorithm: Digital Humanities and Holocaust Memory by Todd Presner. I want to dig deeper into the ethical concerns of digitizing historical data, especially as a Jew who values the memory of the Holocaust.
