My name is Sydney, a current senior at the University of Pennsylvania studying Cognitive Science with a minor in Survey Research and Data Analytics. This course has allowed me to expland on my analytical skills by introducing me to new and creative ways to discover stories behind the historical data. This portfolio highlights and reflects on my journey throughout this Introduction to Digital Humanities course.
